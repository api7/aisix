AISIX AI Gateway evaluates every LLM request against multiple rate-limit layers. Each layer is independent — the request must pass **all** of them, otherwise the proxy returns `429`.

Use this page to decide where each limit belongs and what caller-visible behavior to expect when a layer trips.

## Current Rate-Limit Sources

The proxy applies these layers in order, on every LLM endpoint that goes through the shared quota gate:

1. **API-key inline limit** — `ApiKey.rate_limit` on the authenticated key.
2. **Model inline limit** — `Model.rate_limit` on the resolved model.
3. **Rate-limit policy entities** — standalone `RateLimitPolicy` rows that match the current request by scope.

Layers are AND-combined: every layer with a configured limit must have headroom, or the request is rejected before dispatch.

## Inline Rate-Limit Fields

`ApiKey.rate_limit` and `Model.rate_limit` share the same shape:

- `tpm`: tokens per minute
- `tpd`: tokens per day
- `rpm`: requests per minute
- `rpd`: requests per day
- `concurrency`: maximum in-flight requests

All fields are optional. A missing field means no limit on that dimension. An empty `rate_limit` object behaves as no limit.

In practice, most deployments start with:

- `rpm` for request burst control
- `concurrency` for in-flight protection
- `tpm` or `tpd` where usage-based control matters

Example on an API key:

```json title="ApiKey rate limits"
{
  "key_hash": "YOUR_CALLER_KEY_HASH",
  "allowed_models": ["gpt-4o-prod"],
  "rate_limit": {
    "rpm": 60,
    "tpm": 100000,
    "concurrency": 5
  }
}
```

## Rate-Limit Policy Entities

`RateLimitPolicy` is a standalone, scope-targeted rate-limit rule stored in etcd under `rate_limit_policies/<id>`. Use it when the limit you want is not naturally attached to a single API key or model — for example, a per-team request quota or a per-member token quota.

### Policy Fields

- `name`: human label (string, required).
- `scope`: which subject the policy targets — one of `api_key`, `model`, `team`, `member`, `team_member` (required).
- `scope_ref`: the resource ID the policy applies to. Interpretation depends on `scope`:
  - `api_key` → matches when the authenticated `ApiKey` entry id equals `scope_ref`.
  - `model` → matches when the resolved `Model` entry id equals `scope_ref`.
  - `team` → matches when the authenticated `ApiKey.team_id` equals `scope_ref`. **One shared bucket** is pooled across every key in the team.
  - `member` → matches when the authenticated `ApiKey.user_id` equals `scope_ref`.
  - `team_member` → matches when the authenticated `ApiKey.team_id` equals `scope_ref` (like `team`), but the counter is bucketed **per member** (`ApiKey.user_id`). One policy thus gives *every* member of the team their own independent, identical quota — a per-member default. New members inherit it automatically; no per-member policy needed.
- `window`: `second`, `minute`, or `hour` (required).
- `max_requests`: maximum requests allowed in the window (optional).
- `max_tokens`: maximum tokens allowed in the window (optional).

At least one of `max_requests` or `max_tokens` must be set, or the policy is rejected by validation.

### Window Mapping

Policies are normalised to the same internal limit fields used by inline limits:

| `window` | `max_requests` becomes | `max_tokens` becomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `second` | `rpm` (× 60) | `tpm` (× 60) |
| `minute` | `rpm` | `tpm` |
| `hour` | `rpd` (× 24) | `tpd` (× 24) |

Out-of-enum window values are rejected by the JSON Schema at etcd load — the row never enters the snapshot and is surfaced through the rejection signal.

### Example Policies

A team-wide token cap of 1M tokens per minute:

```json title="RateLimitPolicy: per-team tokens-per-minute"
{
  "name": "team-acme-tpm",
  "scope": "team",
  "scope_ref": "team-uuid-acme",
  "window": "minute",
  "max_tokens": 1000000
}
```

A per-member burst limit:

```json title="RateLimitPolicy: per-member requests-per-minute"
{
  "name": "member-burst",
  "scope": "member",
  "scope_ref": "member-uuid-1234",
  "window": "minute",
  "max_requests": 60
}
```

A per-member default — every member of a team independently capped at 1M tokens per minute:

```json title="RateLimitPolicy: per-member default for a team"
{
  "name": "team-acme-per-member-tpm",
  "scope": "team_member",
  "scope_ref": "team-uuid-acme",
  "window": "minute",
  "max_tokens": 1000000
}
```

Unlike `scope = team` (one shared bucket for the whole team), `team_member` gives each member their own bucket: member A exhausting the cap never throttles member B, and a member's multiple keys share one bucket (the counter keys on `user_id`).

For `scope = team`, `scope = member`, or `scope = team_member` to match, the authenticated `ApiKey` must carry the corresponding `team_id` / `user_id` field. `team_member` requires **both** `team_id` (to match) and `user_id` (to bucket). Set those on the API key resource at create time.

### Provisioning

`RateLimitPolicy` rows are loaded directly from etcd into the gateway snapshot. The standalone admin API does not currently expose CRUD routes for them — write rows under `<prefix>/rate_limit_policies/<id>` through your control-plane projection or directly via `etcdctl` in self-hosted setups.

The data plane validates each row against the JSON Schema on load: a malformed row is skipped and surfaced through the rejection signal, but does not stop other rows from loading.

## Response Behavior

When any layer rejects the request, the proxy returns `429`. For rate-limit-style rejections that have a retry window, the proxy also emits `Retry-After`.

Successful non-streaming chat responses include `x-ratelimit-*` headers based on the post-dispatch limiter state. Those headers are useful for debugging and for client-side adaptive throttling.

## Operator Guidance

- put caller-facing safety limits on `ApiKey.rate_limit`
- use `Model.rate_limit` to protect a specific upstream model alias
- use `RateLimitPolicy` rows when the limit applies to a population that is wider than one key or one model — for example, a whole team
- keep token-based caps proportionate to the burst-control caps; a tight `rpm` with an unlimited `tpm` lets a single long completion still saturate upstream

## Troubleshooting

### A caller sees `429` unexpectedly

Walk the layers in order:

1. inspect the `ApiKey.rate_limit` on the authenticated key
2. inspect the resolved `Model.rate_limit`
3. list the `rate_limit_policies` rows that match the key's `team_id` / `user_id` and the resolved model entry id

Any one of those can be the gating layer.

### A team-scope or member-scope policy is not taking effect

Check the API key. `team` and `member` policies match against `ApiKey.team_id` and `ApiKey.user_id` respectively. If those fields are missing on the key, the policy will never match.

### Limits work for chat but appear silent on other endpoints

The shared quota gate runs across the current LLM endpoint set. If you only see limits triggering on chat, the most likely explanation is that the other endpoint isn't seeing enough traffic to hit the cap, not that the gate is chat-only.
