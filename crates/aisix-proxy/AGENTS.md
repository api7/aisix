## Response-body streams and spawned tasks must re-attach the request span

`request_id::ensure_request_id` opens the `request{request_id=…}` span that puts a
`request_id` on every log line a request emits — that field is what joins a deep
diagnostic (e.g. the Aliyun guardrail's `aliyun_request_id`) back to the
`x-aisix-request-id` the caller was handed.

Two places fall outside it, and neither errors when missed — the logs are just
silently uncorrelated, which reads exactly like working code:

- **Streamed response bodies.** Hyper polls the generator after the middleware has
  returned. Wrap it in `request_id::in_request_span(…)` **from the handler's
  stack** (it captures `Span::current()`, so calling it elsewhere attaches a no-op
  span). Every `async_stream::stream!` returned as a body needs this.
- **Detached tasks.** Anything reached via `tokio::spawn` or axum's
  `WebSocketUpgrade::on_upgrade` inherits nothing; attach the span to the future
  with `.instrument()` (see `realtime::realtime`).

Do not hold a span guard across an await to work around this — it leaks the span
onto whatever the executor runs next on that thread.
